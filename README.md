# Trout's Mouth Landing

An interactive story about connection, lonliness, and family. After 20 years, you've started to wonder what your parents were like. You were so young when they disappeared, it's hard to rememember which parts of them are real and which parts you've invented after so much time. Regardless, you only have one idea of where to start. The blighted fishing town of Trout's Mouth Landing.
