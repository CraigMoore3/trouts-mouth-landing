# Trout's Mouth Landing

An interactive story about loss, connection, family and place. Following the death of your mother, you realise how little you know about the lives your parents led. You were so young when your father dissappeared, it's hard to rememember which parts of him are real and which parts you've invented after so much time. Regardless, you only have one idea of where to start. The blighted fishing town of Trout's Mouth Landing.
